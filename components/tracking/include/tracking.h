    Algorithm Overview:
    The tracking system uses time-of-motion control with daily homing to mechanical
    stops. This eliminates the need for position sensors while maintaining reasonable
    accuracy over long deployments.

    Key Features:
    1. Install-time calibration: manually align to sun, long-press button to learn
       mount orientation offsets. After this, base can be bolted any direction.
    2. Nightly homing: drives both axes to hard stops before sleep, assigns known
       angles. This bounds accumulated error from open-loop control.
    3. Dynamic cadence: checks every 5 minutes until sun moves ≥10°, then every
       15 minutes after commanding a move.
    4. Deep sleep: powers down during night/low sun, wakes before sunrise.

    Coordinate Systems:
    - "Earth frame": standard geographic coordinates (0°=North, elevation from horizon)
    - "Mount frame": panel coordinate system after applying installation offsets
    - Conversion: mount_target = earth_sun - mount_offset (learned during calibration)

    Tracking Strategy:
    - Only move when sun changes ≥10° (avoids unnecessary wear and power consumption)
    - Minimum 2° steps to avoid tiny jitter movements
    - 10° tolerance accounts for linkage backlash and open-loop uncertainty
    - Priority on robustness over precision (solar panels are forgiving)

    Error Sources & Mitigation:
    - Battery voltage variation: daily homing resets accumulated position error
    - Temperature effects on actuator speed: bounded by nightly calibration  
    - Wind loading during moves: 300ms timing buffer helps ensure completion
    - Mechanical backlash: 10° tolerance masks small positioning errors
    - GPS time drift: system syncs time from GPS periodically

    Power Management:
    - Deep sleep during night reduces average power to ~10-50µA
    - Wake-before-sunrise ensures panels positioned for maximum morning capture
    - Motor moves are brief (few seconds) with long idle periods (5-15 minutes)
    - LED patterns optimized for low duty cycle during normal tracking

    Failure Modes:
    - GPS loss: uses last known position until signal recovers (LED_ERROR pattern)
    - SD card failure: continues operation but loses data logging
    - Motor stall: daily homing against stops verifies mechanical operation
    - Power brownout: NVS persistence preserves state across reboots

    Tracker state and configuration.

    Angles:
      - All angles in degrees.
      - "Earth frame" azimuth = 0..360° from true North, positive eastward.
      - "Mount frame" = the panel/mount's own coordinate system after applying
        installation offsets (az_mount_offset_deg, el_mount_offset_deg).

    Offsets:
      - az_mount_offset_deg/el_mount_offset_deg are learned once (manually align to sun,
        long-press button). They let the algorithm ignore how the base is bolted.

    Homing:
      - Sensorless homing at sunset: drive to mechanical stops for a known pose
        (AZ fully retracted, EL fully extended). This bounds daily drift.

    2. Initializes CSV logging with headers
    3. Runs main tracking loop with GPS polling and solar calculations
    4. Handles sleep/wake cycles based on sun position
    5. Manages dynamic cadence based on sun motion
    
    Task specifications:

    - Priority: 5 (higher than LED patterns, lower than critical drivers)
    - Persistent: runs continuously until deep sleep
    
    The task is non-blocking - this function returns immediately after task creation.
    Use LED patterns and SD logs to monitor tracking system health.

    Perform install-time mount offset calibration.
    
    This function should be called when:
    1. The panel is manually aligned to point directly at the sun
    2. GPS has a valid fix (for accurate sun position calculation)
    3. User confirms alignment (typically via long-press button)
    
    Process:
    1. Read current GPS position and UTC time
    2. Calculate sun position in earth coordinates
    3. Compute offsets: mount_offset = sun_earth - panel_mount_current
    4. Store offsets in NVS for future tracking operations
    
    After calibration:
    - The base orientation no longer matters for tracking accuracy
    - Future sun targets are: mount_target = sun_earth - stored_offset
    - Calibration can be repeated anytime (e.g., after mechanical adjustments)
    
    Error handling:
    - Silently fails if no GPS fix available
    - Logs calibration values to SD card and console
    - Safe to call from any task (uses mutex if needed)
    
    Use when the panel is manually aligned to the sun; computes az/el offsets so
    future tracking doesn't depend on base orientation.
